# Libft

The **Libft** project from [42 School](https://42.fr) is about re-creating key functions of the C standard library and building a **personal library** of reusable C functions.  
This serves as the foundation for future projects at 42.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- Implement standard libc functions (like `strlen`, `strdup`, `memcpy`, etc).
- Create additional utility functions for strings, memory, linked lists, etc.
- Build everything into a **static library (`libft.a`)**.
- Learn memory management and practice **clean, modular C code**.

make        # builds libft.a
make clean  # removes object files
make fclean # removes .a library and objects
make re     # rebuild everything
